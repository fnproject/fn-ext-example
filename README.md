# fn-plugin-example

Example for adding third party plugins to fn project server.

This repo includes an example called `logspam`.

## Method 1 - for end users / operators

This will build a custom Docker image for you with the extensions you provide in a yaml file built in.

```yaml
extensions:
  - name: github.com/fnproject/fn-ext-example/logspam
  - name: github.com/treeder/fn-ext-example2/logspam2
```

Build it:

```sh
fn build-server -t imageuser/imagename
```

Now run your new server:

```sh
docker run --privileged --rm --name fnserver -it -v $PWD/data:/app/data -p 8080:8080 imageuser/imagename
```

And deploy a function to try it out:

```sh
fn init --runtime go myfunc
cd myfunc
fn deploy --local --app myapp
fn call myapp /myfunc
```

## Method 2 - for extension developers

This method is good for extension developers as it's fast builds for dev/testing.

Copy [main.go](https://github.com/fnproject/fn/blob/master/cmd/fnserver/main.go) from `fn` repo, then add plugins. See [main.go](main.go) in this
repo for an example.

Then assuming you have the fn project in your GOPATH or you've vendored it here, it should build:

```sh
go build -o fnserver
./fnserver
```

Then deploy a function and you'll see the special spam output like this:

```txt
